      <p>
        This specification describes the core set of technologies that define the baseline platform
        for mobile Web applications to target. It does not create any new technology but rather syndicates
        them into a globally coherent view of the Web platform as available on mobile devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is Level 0, the first iteration. As the platform evolves and new technologies become broadly
        available, additional levels, which are guaranteed to remain backwards compatible, will be layered
        on top of the present one.

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        This document is not mobile-specific, but rather mobile-scoped. This is to say that there is no part
        of its content that applies solely to mobile terminals, or to any particular device class; all of its
        recommendations work and apply equally well across the entire Web. It does however focus on addressing
        issues commonly found in developing Web applications on mobile devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does so by taking a platform view of Web application development in the mobile ecosystem. As things
        currently stand, there is a large body of diverse specifications at varied degrees of maturity that
        are supported on mobile devices. These specifications are designed to work together, but also to be
        implementable separately. Because of this, and because of the great variety of vendors involved in
        the mobile platform, we currently have an ecosystem in which different vendors have elected to support
        different subsets of the complete group of technologies currently in development. This fragmentation makes
        it particularly difficult for developers to know which features they may rely on in creating applications,
        which in turn hurts the development of the entire Web ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        By taking the platform view, this document defines a common baseline that is expected to be universally
        available to developers (or sufficiently close to that to be useful). It does not replace any existing
        specification, be it considered stable or in continuous development. Its only goal is to define a baseline
        target platform that vendors can align on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no case should this be considered a cap on the features that an application may use — developers are 
        considered to know what they are doing and to be naturally free to use any functionality not included in
        this core baseline according to their own judgement. It is not intended to be the final word on the 
        Web platform either, rather the intent of the group in charge of this document is to produce multiple
        levels in quick succession that will layer atop one another as parts of the platform that are reliably
        usable stabilise sufficiently and can be driven to adoption and deployment. For this first level, we
        have started off the intersection of what is available in the most popular mobile platforms. Future levels
        will assume more of a driving role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus in writing this series of documents is entirely driven by developer needs. There may at times
        be some corner case issues that would require deep exegesis of this or that specification were we to address
        them. But unless a demonstrated interoperability issue can be exposed that concerns a real-world
        use case for such corner case behaviours, such exegesis will not take place and we will gladly ignore
        these darker corners. At times some choices may be messy, or even against known best practices. But if they
        are the most pragmatic option, they will be chosen.
